# NetworkViz

## USAGE:

- Open up cmd prompt and navigate to "NetworkViz"
- "python web.py"

- navigate to "http://localhost:5000/" in the browser

- Copy paste the query from the "\NetworkViz\query1.json" into the text box
- Hit the submit button twice and wait for a few seconds
- There should be a visualization below the text box. You can zoom in/out drag/drop nodes
- Please wait. It takes a bit of time. If it's taking more than 30 sec. Press submit again.

note: I realize the height of the visualization is buggy. I think it's due to the number of nodes being rendered.
