# NetworkViz
Requirements:
- Node.js
- Python 3

## USAGE:

### Setting up Flask Server:
- Open up cmd prompt and navigate to "NetworkViz"
- "set FLASK_APP=web.py"
- "flask run -p 5000"

### Setting up the web page:
- navigate to "\NetworkViz\ReactNetworkViz\my-ap\build"
- "npm start"

### Using it:
- Copy paste the query from the "\NetworkViz\query1.json" into the text box
- Hit the submit button twice and wait for a few seconds
- There should be a visualization below the text box. You can zoom in/out drag/drop nodes


I realize the height of the visualization is buggy. I think it's due to the number of nodes being rendered.
